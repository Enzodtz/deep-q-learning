Simple Deep Q Learning Implementation

### The project

This project implements deep q learning without a target network. It solves the CartPole environment but can solve others too. I'm working on the solving of atari games with convnets as well.

### Study

I'm currently studying reinforcement learning throught [University of Alberta Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
